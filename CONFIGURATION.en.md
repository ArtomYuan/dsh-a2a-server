# dsh-a2a-server Configuration & Mechanics

> Status: **P2a streaming intermediate events + context map cleanup**. The A2A
> server business logic is in place (node:http + Bearer auth +
> `@a2a-js/sdk` JsonRpcTransportHandler + AgentExecutor → synchronous dsh session
> execution); `message.contextId` maps to a dsh session (reuse + resume across
> restart); `preset` is configurable (including agent-team); `SendStreamingMessage`
> pushes thinking / tool / status / text intermediate events in real time; the
> contextMap performs TTL cleanup. Since 0.3.0 it is **compatible with both dsh
> 0.1.5 and 0.2.0** (see "dsh 0.1.5 / 0.2.0 dual-version compatibility").

## Installation (full methods)

This library is an independent public bundle package (not a package inside the
dsh workspace), distributed as a standalone bundle. Choose one of three methods.

### Method A: npm (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server
```

The official default channel (`dsh plugin add` without a prefix installs from the
npm registry); published to npm with a prebuilt `lib/`, so no build authorization
is required. Pin a version when needed: `@artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server@0.3.0`.

### Method B: GitHub install (for unreleased changes)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add github:ArtomYuan/dsh-a2a-server#<commit>
```

- **The commit must be pinned** (`#<sha>`): git installs pull source code rather
  than build artifacts, and pinning the commit prevents later pushes from
  silently changing the code executed at install time.
- **allowBuilds authorization**: pnpm >=10 refuses to run the `prepare` script of
  a git dependency by default. The first `add` fails and tells you to add the
  package key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

  ```yaml
  allowBuilds:
    @artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server: true
  ```

  Then rerun `add`. This authorization equals **allowing this package's code to
  run on your machine at install time** (outside the agent sandbox); only grant
  it to trusted sources with a pinned commit.

### Method C: tarball

```sh
pnpm pack                 # produces artomyuan-dsh-a2a-server-<version>.tgz
dsh plugin --profile <name> add ./artomyuan-dsh-a2a-server-<version>.tgz
```

### Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> remove @artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server
```

## Package structure (bundle)

- `package.json`: the `dsh.bundle.patch` declaration plus `@deepseek-ai/cordis`
  peer/dev mirror.
- `cordis.patch.yml`: an array of patch entries that `insert` one A2A server
  plugin line. It does **not** `insert` an `agent-presets` line (the full
  profile's web-app bundle already provides it; inserting it again fails to load
  with a duplicate entry id); a dsh-base-only profile must add the
  `agent-presets` line itself.
- `src/index.ts`: the plugin entry (`name` / `inject` / `apply`).
- `tsdown.prepare.config.ts`: the self-contained transpile config for `prepare`
  on git installs (transpiles `src/` → `lib/`, no project references, no type
  checking).

## Service API

The A2A server exposes two endpoints (JSON-RPC binding, protocol version `1.0`):

- `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json`: the agent card (JSON; the auth check runs
  before any routing, so once `authToken` is set this endpoint also requires a
  Bearer token). Contains
  `supportedInterfaces[].protocolBinding = "JSONRPC"`, `protocolVersion = "1.0"`,
  `capabilities.streaming = true`.
- `POST /`: JSON-RPC. `method: "SendMessage"` (blocking) carries the user text
  message; the server's `AgentExecutor` submits the text to a dsh agent session
  for synchronous execution, and the final output is returned as an artifact
  (`lastChunk: true`). The task status flow is `submitted → working → completed`.
  `method: "SendStreamingMessage"` (streaming) takes the same parameters but
  pushes intermediate events progressively over SSE (see "Streaming intermediate
  events" below).

Auth: once `authToken` is configured, every request must carry
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`, otherwise `401`.

### contextId session mapping

`params.message.contextId` (derived by Hermes from origin) maps to a dsh session —
the same contextId reuses the same dsh session (continuous context), different
contextIds are isolated. The mapping is persisted to
`$DSH_HOME/storages/a2a-context-map.json` (format
`contextId\0cwd → {sessionId, lastUsedAt}`); after a server restart the same
contextId resumes via `ctx.agents.resume`; entries are TTL-cleaned by
`lastUsedAt` (default 7 days). When contextId is absent the server generates a
random contextId (equivalent to creating a new session each time, no reuse).

### Streaming intermediate events

Under `SendStreamingMessage`, DshAgentExecutor subscribes to the dsh agent's
`session/event` and pushes high-signal intermediate events as A2A streaming events
in real time —

- text chunks → `artifactUpdate` (text Part, `artifactId: "stream-text"`,
  `append: true`);
- reasoning, tool calls/results, turn boundaries → `artifactUpdate` (**data Part
  private extension**, `mediaType: application/json`, value is a JSON descriptor).

The data Part descriptor `kind` values: `thinking` (`{text}`), `tool_call`
(`{name, arguments}`), `tool_result` (`{name, text}`), `turn_start` /
`turn_end` (`{turn, step, reason?}`). During the test phase reasoning is passed
through verbatim for verification.

## Events

A synchronous task (`SendMessage`) returns task → statusUpdate → artifact →
statusUpdate. A streaming task (`SendStreamingMessage`) additionally pushes
thinking / tool / status / text intermediate events in real time (see "Streaming
intermediate events"), then the final artifact completes.

## Extension points / configuration (full field list)

`Config` fields (cordis.yml plugin `config`; the token can also be read from the
environment variable `A2A_SERVER_TOKEN`):

- `port`: listen port (defaults to probing 8092/8093/8094 for the first free port).
- `host`: listen address (default `127.0.0.1`, local only).
- `authToken`: Bearer token (enforced once set).
- `provider`: backend provider (default `deepseek-official`).
- `model`: execution model (default `deepseek-v4-flash`; empty string = follow the
  dsh user/default setting).
- `preset`: the agent preset to mount (default `standard`; can be `agent-team`
  etc., see below).
- `cwd`: task working directory (default process cwd).
- `contextMapPath`: persistent file path for the contextId→session mapping
  (default `$DSH_HOME/storages/a2a-context-map.json`).
- `contextMapTtlDays`: mapping entry TTL in days (default 7; expired entries are
  cleaned on load/write).

Injected dependencies: `agents`, `agentPresets`, `sessions`.

## Settings panel

The dsh Web UI "Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration" automatically shows an
`a2a-server` settings card as soon as the plugin is included in the profile — no
changes to the dsh repository and no whitelist are required. It is implemented on
the official dsh settings seam: the host side registers the `a2a-server` settings
namespace (schema defined by schemastery), and the browser side provides a settings
card.

The card is collapsible, matching the official dsh plugin cards: it starts
collapsed, and clicking its header expands or collapses it. While edits are
unsaved the header carries an "Unsaved" marker, and a successful save collapses
the card again. Collapsing never discards drafts.

### Configuration layering

- The plugin `config` in `cordis.patch.yml` remains the composition (base) layer and
  source of truth;
- Edits made in the panel are written to the dsh user settings document
  `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`, as the **user override layer**;
- Resolution order: schema defaults < `cordis.patch.yml` < user overrides.

The panel marks which fields are overridden by the user layer and offers "Clear
override" to fall back to the value in `cordis.patch.yml`.

### Fields and effective timing

| Field | Default / empty-value semantics | Effective timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | Empty = auto-probe a free port at startup | Requires a dsh restart (or profile reload) |
| `host` | Non-empty (validated) | Requires a dsh restart (or profile reload) |
| `authToken` | Secret field, write-only | Next A2A request (no restart) |
| `provider` | Default `deepseek-official` | Next A2A request (no restart) |
| `model` | Default `deepseek-v4-flash`; empty string = follow the dsh current default model | Next A2A request (no restart) |
| `preset` | Default `standard` | Next A2A request (no restart) |
| `cwd` | Empty string = `process.cwd()` | Next A2A request (no restart) |
| `contextMapPath` | Empty = `$DSH_HOME/storages/a2a-context-map.json` | Requires a dsh restart (or profile reload) |
| `contextMapTtlDays` | Default 7 | Next flush cleanup (no restart) |

After saving `port` / `host` / `contextMapPath`, the running instance keeps listening
on the startup address until dsh is restarted (or the profile reloaded).

### Credentials (authToken)

- The panel is write-only for `authToken` (always shows "Set / Not set", input starts
  empty; a blank input = no change).
- "Clear override" only removes the user-layer override and falls back to the existing
  token in `cordis.patch.yml`; it never silently disables auth.
- When the final resolved value is empty, the panel explicitly warns "Not set = no
  auth (dangerous)".
- The `A2A_SERVER_TOKEN` environment variable takes precedence over configuration; in
  that case the panel shows "managed by environment variable" and is not editable.

### Degradation

When the settings service is absent the plugin keeps working, using only the
`cordis.patch.yml` configuration; the settings card does not appear in that profile.

### Installation & build

No extra install steps: `link:` or a normal install followed by a dsh restart is
enough. The published artifact ships both the host output `lib/` and the browser
output `client/`; git installs build both halves automatically via the `prepare`
script.

## agent-team mount (deployment notes)

The `agent-team` preset depends on the tool-subagent `modelSelectionSettings`
(web-app-only host service `subagent-model-selection-settings`) and nine Team
tools (from the `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team-profile` bundle). A
dsh-base-only standalone profile lacks these host lines, so they must be added to
the profile's cordis tree (equivalent to the agent-team-profile bundle's
`cordis.patch.yml` + the web-app host lines). dsh-base also does not provide the
`agent-presets` line, so it must be inserted as well (the full profile's web-app
already provides it; duplicating it creates a duplicate entry id):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: agent-presets
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-presets'
      config:
        default: minimal
- id: tool-subagent-control
  disabled: true
- id: tool-subagent-list-agents
  disabled: true
- id: tool-subagent
  config:
    provider: spawn
    toolName: subagent
    backgroundMode: one-shot
- id: tool-subagent-fork
  config:
    provider: fork
    toolName: subagent_fork
    backgroundMode: one-shot
- insert:
    - id: subagent-model-selection-settings
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-subagent/model-selection-settings'
    - id: agent-team
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team'
      config:
        maxMembers: 8
        maxTasks: 256
        maxPendingMessagesPerMember: 64
        maxMessageBytes: 65536
        disposalTimeoutMs: 5000
    - id: tool-agent-team
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-tool-agent-team'
      config:
        freshProvider: spawn
        forkProvider: fork
- id: a2a-server
  config:
    preset: agent-team
```

Where `@deepseek-ai/dsh-experimental-agent-team` / `-tool-agent-team` must be
resolvable (the full profile ships them; a standalone profile mounts them via
`dsh plugin add link:<source-tree-path>`). The `agent-team` preset itself comes
from the user root (`$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets/agent-team`, `includeUserRoot`
includes it by default).

## dsh 0.1.5 / 0.2.0 dual-version compatibility

Since 0.3.0 this plugin supports both the dsh 0.1.5-rc.2 and 0.2.0-rc.2
runtimes (the `package.json` peer range covers both), as the prerequisite for a
future switch/rollback. The compatibility logic lives in `src/compat.ts` and
follows "feature detection + loud degradation".

### Version detection mechanism

`dshRuntimeVersion()` resolves `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent/package.json` via
`createRequire(import.meta.url)` (both 0.1.x and 0.2.0 export that subpath,
verified in the sandbox) and reads its `version` field. On failure it returns
`undefined` (never throws); everything then falls back to 0.1.5 behavior with a
single explicit `console.warn` line (production today is 0.1.5 — keep the status
quo rather than silently change behavior).

### Two message source shapes (A1)

0.1.5's `MessageSourceMap` has a `plugin` kind (`{kind:'plugin', plugin:…}`);
0.2.0 removed that kind (only model/tool/system-prompt remain) and namespace-izes
plugin messages as `kind: 'plugin:<name>'`. `pluginMessageSource()` returns,
per the detection above:

- 0.2.x: `{ kind: 'plugin:dsh-a2a-server' }`
- 0.1.x or detection failure: `{ kind: 'plugin', plugin: 'dsh-a2a-server' }`

Sending the legacy shape on 0.2.0 makes the message **never enter the agent
loop — the task silently does not execute** (looks COMPLETED but yields
`(no text output)`), so this is the hard gate of the dual-version adaptation.

### Dual-shape tool_result (A2)

The `tool/result` session event differs between the v3 and v4 session formats;
`readToolResult()` reads `{ callId, text }` with precedence v4 → v3 →
`data.callId`:

- v4 (0.2.0, measured): `toolCallId` on the message level, `content` already
  flattened into text blocks;
- v3 (0.1.5): `message.content[0].toolCallId` +
  `message.content[0].content[0].text`.

Wire event field names are unchanged (`kind/turn/step/name/text`); the tool name
keeps the existing `callId→name` lookup recorded at `tool/call`. When no shape
matches it returns both fields as `undefined` — no throw, no event-stream change.

### Settings panel on 0.2.0 — current state and follow-up (A3)

The panel registration goes through the official settings seam, feature-detected
into three branches:

1. `settings.installSection` exists (0.1.5 today): the original path, panel works;
2. only `settings.register`: replicate equivalent semantics with register +
   `scope.watch` (conservative; no published version hits this branch);
3. neither exists (**0.2.0 today**: its npm release has no `installSection` /
   `register` / `SettingsScope` at all): one loud warn naming the cause and the
   follow-up; the panel is unavailable on 0.2.0 but **the rest of the A2A
   service keeps working**.

On 0.2.0, configuration changes fall back to editing `cordis.patch.yml` (or
`settings.yaml`) + restart. The full port is a mid-size refactor: Config declared
in schemastery with reactive-thunk fields (`config.x.get()`), following the
Config-as-thunks pattern of 0.2.0's own plugins (migration report §A3); pending.

### 0.2.0's version gate and exemption (A4)

0.2.0 added a runtime compatibility gate: a plugin whose peer range does not
cover the installed dsh version is refused with `Plugin … is incompatible with
dsh 0.2.0-rc.2`. Since 0.3.0 the peer range is widened (`… || ^0.2.0-rc.2`), so
**fresh installs no longer need the exemption**; deployments still running an
old version (≤0.2.1) on 0.2.0 do:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <p> allow-version @artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server@<old-version> --dsh-version 0.2.0-rc.2 --accept-risk
```

### Session resume diagnostics (A9)

Resuming a v3 session with an old contextId on 0.2.0 fails and falls back to a
new session (the v3→v4 open fails). The plugin keeps the existing degradation
unchanged (no throw, drop the mapping, create new) but now logs a diagnostic:
the error `name`/`code`/`message` and the first 3 `stack` lines, explicitly
stating `falling back to a NEW session (contextId mapping dropped)`.

## Design notes

- Conversation semantics: A2A `message.contextId` ↔ dsh session. The same
  contextId reuses the same dsh session (continuous context), different
  contextIds are isolated; two-level takeover (persisted mapping hit → resume,
  miss → create + write mapping); the mapping persists across restart and
  resumes, with TTL cleanup (default 7 days). On task completion, flush + release
  the handle.
- Streaming granularity: the blocking `SendMessage` returns the final result;
  `SendStreamingMessage` pushes thinking / tool / status / text intermediate
  events in real time (text Part + data Part private extension).
- Transport choice: JSON-RPC over node:http (self-built listener, not express);
  the agent card is served from the `/.well-known/agent-card.json`
  endpoint (also protected by Bearer auth).

## Naming

- Package name: `@artomyuan/dsh-a2a-server` (the `name` referenced by the bundle patch for
  Node resolution).
- Patch line logical id: `a2a-server`.
- Plugin role: `Executor` (corresponds to the A2A `AgentExecutor` mapping, which
  submits the A2A task text to a dsh agent session for execution).

## Development

```sh
pnpm install      # independent workspace (isolated by pnpm-workspace.yaml, does not touch the main repo lockfile)
pnpm run build    # tsdown transpiles src/ → lib/ (standalone, no project references)
pnpm run typecheck # tsc --noEmit
```

`lib/index.js` is transpiled directly by tsdown (ESM); `@deepseek-ai/*` and
`@a2a-js/sdk` are external dependencies and are not bundled into the artifact;
they are resolved inside the profile at runtime.
